``` r
x <- 1 / 13 * 56
sin(x)
```

    ## [1] -0.9192219

``` r
y <- (36 + 78 - 1576) / 2
cos(y)
```

    ## [1] -0.5477797

``` r
sin(pi /2)
```

    ## [1] 1

``` r
my_name_is_emily_and_i_aint_gonna_change_it <- 3
my_name_is_emily_and_i_aint_gonna_change_it + 5
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
#Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
#my_varıable
```

^For above: `it looks like there's no bleeping dot on the i which is why it wont code properly. I could be wrong, but I don't think I am. I had to comment it out though in order for me to knit.`

`**pressing ALT + SHIFT+ K is the most incredible thing I've learned so far in R! That's so cool and convenient!**`

#### the short-cut given in chapter 6 about creating more workspace is not working for me as an 'Incognito' browser page opens up each time.

``` r
x <- "cats"
y <- "I love"
paste(y, x)
```

    ## [1] "I love cats"

``` r
#here I used the Cmd + Enter key to run the three codes
```

``` r
#example with that block
#library(dplyr)
#library(nycflights13)
#not_cancelled <- flights %>%
# filter(!is.na(dep_delay)█, !is.na(arr_delay))

#not_cancelled %>% 
# group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
#summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))#
```

``` r
#example without that block
#library(dplyr)
#library(nycflights13)
#not_cancelled <- flights %>%

#not_cancelled %>% 
# group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
#summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```

I see here that both codes do not run. I'm not sure why though. I don't fully understand what that block does, too. I COMMENTED THEM OUT so that the Rmd would knit.

I went to Rstudio Tips on Twitter and...
========================================

I discovered the fact that you can easily access a list of all functions in the open script that can "easily" be navigated. In the video that was shown it looked like I needed to press the last tab or 'button' on the very right of the the bar above^. However, so far it only shows the sentences preceding the \#'s.

``` r
x <- c(1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
mean(x)
```

    ## [1] 4.2

Confirmed, new shortuct learned on Twitter is not necessarily for functions. (Not *really* confirmed but so far...from what I am learning...it is).
